# Creating-Functions-Decisions-and-Looping
In this lab, I implemented functions in code, decisions in code, and repetition structures in code.

Scenario
In this code, I simulate an environment where a student can build their course schedule by adding an instructor name, course titel, and class reminders. Inputs and outputs are passed between the functions and decisions are made based on those.

Objectives
After completing this lab, you will be able to:
•	Implement functions in code.
•	Implement decisions in code.
•	Implement repetition structures in code.

Exercise 1: Implementing Functions
Scenario
In the course tracking program, you want to include the functionality to enter course names and instructor names. The data you want to track would likely be stored in a database or a file on the computer. In this exercise, you will create functions that will allow you to set course names and instructor names that will be collected in the application through functions you will created..
It’s also important that you validate input from users. This is an important rule to remember when you start creating programs that other people use. Validating input allows you to deal with errors in the input data before they cause problems in your code, such as values you didn’t intend to be provided, but also to prevent other security issues such as SQL injection attacks. In this exercise, you will create functions that will allow you to validate the course names and instructor names.

The main tasks for this exercise are as follows:
1.	Create a function that doesn’t return a value.
2.	Call a function that doesn’t return a value.
3.	Create a function that returns a value.
4.	Call a function that returns a value.
