# Creating-Functions-Decisions-and-Looping
In this lab, I implemented functions in code, decisions in code, and repetition structures in code.

Scenario
In this code, I simulate an environment where a student can build their course schedule by adding an instructor name, course title, and class reminders. Inputs and outputs are passed between the functions and decisions are made based on those.

Objectives
After completing this lab, you will be able to:
•	Implement functions in code.
•	Implement decisions in code.
•	Implement repetition structures in code.
